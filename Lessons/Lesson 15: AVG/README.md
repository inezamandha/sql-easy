# Lesson 15: AVG

[View on website](https://www.sql-easy.com/avg)

We can use the `AVG` keyword in order to find the average of a given value.

For example, running `SELECT AVG(num_legs) FROM family_members;` returns the average number of legs of each family member.

Can you find the average num_books_read made by each family member?

Note:
- Because of the way computers handle numbers, averages will not always be completely exact.
