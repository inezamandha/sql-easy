# Lesson 5: WHERE ... Greater than or equal

[View on website](https://www.sql-easy.com/where_greater_than_or_equal)

SQL accepts various inequality symbols, including:
```
= "equal to"
> "greater than"
< "less than"
>= "greater than or equal to"
<= "less than or equal to"
```

Can you return all rows in **family_members** where num_books_read is a value greater or equal to 180?
