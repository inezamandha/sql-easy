# Lesson 4: WHERE ... Greater than

[View on website](https://www.sql-easy.com/where_greater_than)

If we want to only select family members based on a numerical field, we can also use the `WHERE` keyword. For example, if we wanted to select family members with a num_books_read, we would type
`SELECT * FROM family_members WHERE num_books_read > 0;`

Can you run return all rows of family members whose num_books_read is greater than 190?
