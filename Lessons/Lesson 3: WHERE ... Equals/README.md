# Lesson 3: WHERE ... Equals

[View on website](https://www.sql-easy.com/where_equals)

In order to select particular rows from this table, we use the `WHERE` keyword. So for example, if we wanted to grab all of the rows that correspond to humans, we would type
`SELECT * FROM family_members WHERE species = 'human';`
Note that the quotes have to be around the word human, as it is an explicit value, unlike a keyword such as `WHERE`.

Can you run a query that returns all of the rows that refer to dogs?
