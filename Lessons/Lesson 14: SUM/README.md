# Lesson 14: SUM

[View on website](https://www.sql-easy.com/sum)

We can use the `SUM` keyword in order to find the sum of a given value.

For example, running `SELECT SUM(num_legs) FROM family_members;` returns the total number of legs in the family.

Can you find the total num_books_read made by this family?
