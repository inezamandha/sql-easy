# Lesson 2: SELECT specific columns

[View on website](https://www.sql-easy.com/select_columns)

`SELECT *` grabs all fields (called columns) in a table. If we only wanted to see the name and num_books_read columns, we would type
`SELECT name, num_books_read FROM family_members;`

Can you return just the name and species columns?
