# Lesson 12: COUNT(*)

[View on website](https://www.sql-easy.com/count)

Another way to explore a table is to check the number of rows in it. For example, if we are querying a table `states_of_us`, we'd expect 50 rows, or 500 rows in a table called `fortune_500_companies`.

`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM friends_of_pickles;` returns the total number of rows in the table **friends_of_pickles**. Try this for yourself.
