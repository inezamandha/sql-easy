# Lesson 10: ORDER BY

[View on website](https://www.sql-easy.com/order_by)

If you want to sort the rows by some kind of attribute, you can use the `ORDER BY` keyword. For example, if you want to sort the **friends_of_pickles** by name, you would run: `SELECT * FROM friends_of_pickles ORDER BY name;`. That returns the names in ascending alphabetical order.

In order to put the names in descending order, you would add a `DESC` at the end of the query.

Can you run a query that sorts the **friends_of_pickles** by height_cm in descending order?
