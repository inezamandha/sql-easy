# Lesson 16: MAX and MIN

[View on website](https://www.sql-easy.com/max_min)

We can use the `MAX` and `MIN` to find the maximum or minimum value of a table.

To find the least number of legs in a family member (2), you can run
`SELECT MIN(num_legs) FROM family_members;`

Can you find the highest num_books_read that a family member makes?
